## Contribution Guidelines
To keep things simple, instead of forking this repository and submitting pull-requests, every authorized collaborator has write access to this single repository. However, instead of directly pushing to the master branch, please create a branch using the scheme `dev-<your username>` and push your commits there. Finally, you can raise a PR into the master branch which will be merged after a minimal review process.

## Getting Started
The project is based on the [HTML5 Boilerplate](https://html5boilerplate.com) template. Please have a look at the [docs](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate/blob/master/dist/doc/TOC.md) to get an idea of how the project is structured, and the purpose of each file.

### Instructions
#### Markup wireframes with HTML
Review the three wireframes that you produced for the large screen version of your web site from part 1 of the team project and make any changes that you think would improve them. Work through the wireframes and decide on the correct HTML to build those pages. Think carefully about the use of layout tags such as tables, and only use them where content is really a table. Make sure that all the parts of the pages have a semantic identity, either by using existing semantic tags or by defining "div" tags for the content. Attempt to use a range of the various formatting tags available to add richness and extra meaning to your content. Consider how different media can add to the way that your pages communicate information.
Mark up your wireframes with the HTML tags that you intend to use. Upload these marked-up wireframes in a .zip file into the Workspace: static web pages that is located in the end of week 10 and generate a shareable URL. Consider how your HTML supports the use of your pages by users with disabilities.

#### Code HTML pages
Code the three pages in HTML and enter in some essential text content that you write yourself. Name the main/first page of your web site: index.html. Ensure that you use comments to help all the coders to understand the code.
Find some pictures and any other media that you consider appropriate and embed them into the pages using the correct HTML tags. Ensure that your code includes comments to help you work with the code and quickly relate it to the wireframes. It could be helpful to include comments to indicate who contributed chunks of the code so that you can ensure you can work together as a team.

#### Upload the pages to the static web page system
Upload in the .zip file your three pages within a tidy directory structure to the Workspace: static web pages that is located in the end of week 10. Update your shareable link and load the pages in a browser using the shareable URL.
Validate the code in the pages
Validate your code using the W3C code validator.
