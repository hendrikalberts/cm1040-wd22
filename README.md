## Contribution Guidelines
To keep things simple, instead of forking this repository and submitting pull-requests, every authorized collaborator has write access to this single repository. However, instead of directly pushing to the master branch, please create a branch using the scheme `dev-<your username>` and push your commits there. Finally, you can raise a PR into the master branch which will be merged after a minimal review process.
